							According to historians, the lamp was made during the reign of His

            Padmanabha Rao in memory of his father T Rama Rao (who was a former
            Diwan of Travancore). Though there is not enough proof, some say
            that the lamp was lit using kerosene in the past.
            <br />
            This lamp now stands in front of a prominent Protestant church in
